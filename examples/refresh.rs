    // independently and return the result in the main task. For the purpose of that example there is no real
    // networking, but instead a combination of shared state between rust tasks and message channel passing where
    // receiver and sender channels are interleaved for p2p and broadcast communication. That is a SimpleMessageRelay.
    // In a real setup the relayer can be an independent network entity, where all the nodes can talk to. It
    // can be implemented with a variety of existing  networking protocols such as websockets; as long as it follows the
    // underlying pull logic : Each receiver knows what message to subscribe for and so it asks the relayer to deliver it
    // as long as it arrives from the expected sender.
